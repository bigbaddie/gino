## About

> I'm an SEO managing web properties for the Philippines' most wonderful telco. It's both exhausting and exhilarating at the same time.

My experience in the digital space, covering the fields of web development, project management, marketing, analytics, customer service, and even blogging about comic books, helps me think outside the traditional SEO box. I am not beholden to the usual SEO strategies and methodologies. I am always willing to break down walls to see what's on the other side. I am always open to mad content experiments to discover wonderful new ways of working and thinking. I worry less about tools and how to appease the machine gods and more about the humans on the other end of the search bar.

At the enterprise level, this approach can be controversial. My SEO can be seen as chaotic. Maddening, even. But by keeping humans, not machines, at the center of my optimization strategies, my SEO is ultimately undisputed. In the end, it sparks joy and peace. I'm all about the journey and the final, satisfying conclusion.
